Statistical analysis to investigate factors influencing admission deposits in healthcare settings

I conducted a statistical analysis to investigate factors influencing admission deposits in healthcare settings. This statistical analysis goes deep into understanding the intricate factors influencing admission deposits in healthcare settings, crucial for managing healthcare finances and optimizing patient care. Examining variables like hospital type, severity of illness, admission type, and patient demographics, this analysis aims to discover the patterns that contribute to deposit variations. With a backdrop of evolving healthcare landscapes and prior research in healthcare finance and economics, this analysis contributes to evidence-based decision-making in healthcare management, resource allocation, and patient financial assistance programs.

There are some previously performed predictive models on this topic that will help in understanding the admission deposit and length of stay at the hospital better but this project specifically aims at taking a step towards understanding the importance of statistical analysis of the dependent and independent variables to make a better sense of the predictive models implemented.

Data
The dataset sourced from Kaggle - AV : Healthcare Analytics II contains almost 32,000 observations across 18 variables that are very important for understanding hospital management and patient care. Each variable offers valuable insights into hospital dynamics and patient demographics. For instance, variables like Hospital Type Code, City Code, and Ward Type provide context on hospital infrastructure and location, while Age and Severity of Illness shed light on patient demographics and medical condition severity. The Admission_Deposit variable, being the key focus of this project reflects financial aspects of patient admissions, playing a vital role in healthcare finance management. This dataset helps in comprehensive analyses, such as examining the relationship between hospital characteristics and admission deposits, identifying factors influencing patient stays, and optimizing resource allocation for improved patient outcomes and financial sustainability in healthcare institutions.

Research Questions I aim to answer in this project:
Is there a significant difference in admission deposits between different hospital types and severity of illness?
In other words, how do Hospital Type, City Code, severity of illness and Age influence admission deposits?
